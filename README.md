# valentine's special app
(I just wanted to ask my crush out for Valentine's in the nerdiest way possible.)
Welcome to the most romantically confusing React app you'll ever encounter! 

## Features

- **Yes Button:** Please say yes :')

- **No Button:** Does saying 'No' make you feel guilty? Good. It should. I've added a guilt trip progression for your enjoyment.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Q: Why does this exist?
A: Why not? I need love too, you know.

### Q: What's the purpose of the No button?
A: It's a test. If you press it too much, you might break my heart. Be gentle.

### Q: Is this app scientifically proven to improve my love life?
A: We can neither confirm nor deny, but pressing the Yes button might bring unexpected joy to your life.
